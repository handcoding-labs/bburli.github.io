## Professional Summary

Software Architect with **15+ years** of experience building large-scale distributed systems, real-time audio/LLM pipelines, and cloud-native platforms.  
M.Tech in Data Analytics (BITS Pilani).

I architected the current version of **Suki AI’s real-time speech platform**, scaling it from the ground up to:

- **55,000+ hours of audio/day**  
- **50,000+ streaming msgs/sec**  
- **800+ concurrent audio users**  
- **30,000 clinical notes/day**  
- **Sub-second end-to-end latency**  
- **99.99% reliability**

Specialties include:

- Applied LLM systems  
- Real-time audio/ASR/LLM pipelines  
- High-throughput distributed systems  
- Streaming architectures (Redis Streams)  
- Golang, Java, C++, gRPC, Protocol Buffers  
- Healthcare-grade reliability & compliance  
- 0→1 architecture and system scaling  

I design systems where correctness, performance, and reliability matter — and I’ve repeatedly delivered high-impact solutions under pressure.
